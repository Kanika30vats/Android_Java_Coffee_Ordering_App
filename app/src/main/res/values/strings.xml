    <!-- Comment will help translator to understand the context in which the string is being used  in our app -->
    <!-- Character limit is also helpful for the translator when space in UI is limited. -->
    <!-- For example, a translator won't pick a really long translation if they understand that we have limited screen space -->
    <!-- Header text for the list of toppings [CHAR LIMIT=20] -->
    <string name="toppings">Toppings</string>

    <!-- Thank you message for the order summary. [CHAR LIMIT=NONE] -->
    <string name="thank_you">Thank You!</string>

    <!--
        Name for the order summary.
        It will be shown in the format of "Name: Amy",
        where Amy is the user's name. [CHAR LIMIT=NONE]
    -->
    <!--
        We want Name to be translated but we don't want user's name (eg:Amy) to be translated.
        Hence, we used xliff tag.
        %s specifies that a string will be substituted in here later.
    -->
    <!--
        The reason why we didn't add Strings using the plus sign is because:
        declaring it as a string resource allows the translator to decide if this is the right format for the text.
        The translator may decide to flip the order of the some of these words so that it makes more sense to the local context.
        The translator don't have control over the java code.
